        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
        <p>
           Hello everyone,<br>
           My name is <b>Pavani Krishna</b>, and I come from the beautiful city of  <b>Vijayawada</b>.
            I completed my <b>Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intellegence & Data Science</b>, 
            as I have always been fascinated by technology and the way it shapes our lives.
            I would describe myself as a <b>positive, hardworking, and friendly person</b> who believes in building good relationships and spreading kindness.
             I enjoy taking up challenges because I feel they help me grow and learn new skills.<br><br>
             My friends often say that I am approachable and supportive, which I consider one of my strengths.
            Apart from academics, my hobbies include <b>reading novels and listening to music</b>.
             Reading helps me explore different perspectives and improves my imagination, while music gives me peace of mind and keeps me motivated. 
             I am also good at <b> creative writing</b>, which allow me to express myself confidently and share my ideas effectively.
            In terms of my career, my goal is to become a <b> python full stack developer</b>. <br>
            I aspire to contribute to developing innovative solutions that can make people’s lives easier and better. I also believe strongly in <b>continuous learning</b>, 
            because knowledge never ends,and every new experience adds value to who we are.<br>
             — thank you for reading.
